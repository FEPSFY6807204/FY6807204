  In this article I will discuss about the changing climate in the UK. The environmental landscape of the UK is changing as a result of frequent flooding, harsh storms, random heatwaves etc. Coastal regions
  are becoming more vulnerable due to rising sea levels as well. All these natural hazards occur as a result of an increase of global temperature. Many world leader gathered together to discuss about alternative
  methods and strategies which can be used to reduces their carbon footprint and prevent an further increase in Global Warming. It emphasises the need for ongoing research, adaptation measures, and international 
  collaboration.

  <pre>
 Climate change has become an urgent issue in the UK.  But first of all what is climate change? Climate change is commonly understood to be one of the drivers of extinction, affecting biodiversity in nearly every corner
 of the planet. But a few realise that the loss of biodiversity is also making climate change worse and shifting global weather patterns. However climate change is a change in the average global temperature which has many
 consequences. NASA scientist have observed the Earth’s surface and recorded one of the warmest years recorded in the past 2 years. But I specifically want to look at the climate change in the UK. As a result of climate change,
 there has been more flooding events recorded and natural hazard are becoming more frequent not just in the UK, but worldwide. The UK faces a range of consequences as a result of rising global temperatures, including changes in 
 agriculture and biodiversity as well as more frequent and severe weather events. A national effort has been places within the last few years to attempt to reduce our carbon footprint and make sure our ecosystem can be seen by the
 future generation. All the world leaders gathered. together om the 1 of November 2021 in Glasgow, United Kingdom, to discuss about how they can reduce our carbon footprint. They had 3 main objectives. First was their mitigation which
 they want to keep the 1.5-degree warming target. Secondly, they wanted to adapt by witnessing an enhanced global agenda. Thirdly they are investing around USD 100 billion per year by 2025 to help developing country deal with adverse effects
 of climate. In the UK specifically there has been more than 3700 lives claimed since 2000. When it comes to overall impact 343,413 have been impacted by flooding and 61,088 by storms in the UK. The 3 common natural hazard that occurs in the UK
 is flooding, storms and heatwaves. The burning of fossil fuel is probably one of the biggest factor which has increased our global temperature. Fossil fuels release gases such as carbon dioxide which is released into the atmosphere and prevents
 heat from escaping the Earth. When heat gets trapped in the Earth the global tempertaure increases. Even an increase of one celsius can have a massive impact on our world. For example an increase in one celsius may cuases ice from the North and 
 South pole to melt which increases the amount of water in the oceans. This results in a higher risk of flooding and tsnumai. It is predicted that by 2050 sea levels rising threatems cities such as Shanghai, London to low-lying countries like
 Florida, Bangladesh and Maldives to be flooded. Experts have warned that sea levels could increase as much as 10ft(2m) if the glaciers in the West Antarcita.

  <h3 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h3>    
  <pre>
  We can see that over the last few years there has been a significant increase in natural hazards in the UK. And we have to bear in mind we haven’t even finished the 21th century and natural hazards such as flooding has already beaten last
  century’s data, which is concerning. With many research and proof scientist was able to relate this increase in natural hazards back to climate change. Global temperature is ever so fastly increasing at a rate never seen before and we should 
  try prevent it from getting worse. There are many ways to prevent the increase of global tempertures. One of them being preventing the usage of fossil fuel and use renewable enegry in for example cars. But this topic can get a bit contraversial
  since generating electricty for cars is still burning fossil fuels. But there are many alternetives such as wind turbines, which uses wind to generate electreicty as the turbine inside spins. And solar panels whcih uses sun rays to generate     
  electrcity. If we don't acts upon global warming and climate change fast it will be catastrophic for fututre generations in not just the UK but the whole world.
