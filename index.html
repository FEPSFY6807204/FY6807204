  In this article I will discuss about the changing climate in the UK. The environmental landscape of the UK is changing as a result of frequent flooding, harsh storms, random heatwaves etc. Coastal regions
  are becoming more vulnerable due to rising sea levels as well. All these natural hazards occur as a result of an increase of global temperature. Many world leader gathered together to discuss about alternative
  methods and strategies which can be used to reduces their carbon footprint and prevent an further increase in Global Warming. It emphasises the need for ongoing research, adaptation measures, and international 
  collaboration.

 Climate change has become an urgent issue in the UK.  But first of all what is climate change? Climate change is commonly understood to be one of the drivers of extinction, affecting biodiversity in nearly every corner
 of the planet. But a few realise that the loss of biodiversity is also making climate change worse and shifting global weather patterns. However climate change is a change in the average global temperature which has many
 consequences. NASA scientist have observed the Earth’s surface and recorded one of the warmest years recorded in the past 2 years. But I specifically want to look at the climate change in the UK. As a result of climate change,
 there has been more flooding events recorded and natural hazard are becoming more frequent not just in the UK, but worldwide. The UK faces a range of consequences as a result of rising global temperatures, including changes in 
 agriculture and biodiversity as well as more frequent and severe weather events. A national effort has been places within the last few years to attempt to reduce our carbon footprint and make sure our ecosystem can be seen by the
 future generation. All the world leaders gathered. together om the 1 of November 2021 in Glasgow, United Kingdom, to discuss about how they can reduce our carbon footprint. They had 3 main objectives. First was their mitigation which
 they want to keep the 1.5-degree warming target. Secondly, they wanted to adapt by witnessing an enhanced global agenda. Thirdly they are investing around USD 100 billion per year by 2025 to help developing country deal with adverse effects
 of climate. In the UK specifically there has been more than 3700 lives claimed since 2000. When it comes to overall impact 343,413 have been impacted by flooding and 61,088 by storms in the UK. The 3 common natural hazard that occurs in the UK
 is flooding, storms and heatwaves.
