      There are many factors which effects the lifepan of a bridge; from environment factors to increase in traffic volume etc. And as a civil engineering we maintain and repair infrastructure to increase the lifespan. 
      I speciafically want to look into suspension bridges, since they are suspending and it will be much more of a challenge to repair. It is possible to extend a bridges lifespan by 20-30 years by repairing and 
      maintence. Usually after 30 years, the suspension cables should be unwrapped and the interoir and should be inspected carefully in depth. This is done to ensure that the suspension bridge is still able to hold together
      without breaking.
