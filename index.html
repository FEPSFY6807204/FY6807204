  In this article I will discuss about the changing climate in the UK. The environmental landscape of the UK is changing as a result of frequent flooding, harsh storms, random heatwaves etc. Coastal regions
  are becoming more vulnerable due to rising sea levels as well. All these natural hazards occur as a result of an increase of global temperature. Many world leader gathered together to discuss about alternative
  methods and strategies which can be used to reduces their carbon footprint and prevent an further increase in Global Warming. It emphasises the need for ongoing research, adaptation measures, and international 
  collaboration.

  Climate change has become an urgent issue in the UK. As a result of climate change, there has been more flooding events recorded and natural hazard are becoming more frequent not just in the UK,
  but worldwide. The UK faces a range of consequences as a result of rising global temperatures, including changes in agriculture and biodiversity as well as more frequent and severe weather events.
  A national effort has been places within the last few years to attempt to reduce our carbon footprint and make sure our ecosystem can be seen by the future generation.
