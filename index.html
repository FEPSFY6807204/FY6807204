      Suspension bridges, engineering marvels, contain a delicate balance of strength and grace. These structures rely on towering towers, sturdy cables, and a flexible deck to span great distances. Maintenance is a very important and requires regular inspections check for corrosion, fatigue, and stress points. Paint protects against rust,
      and cable strands are monitored for tension. Environmental factors like saltwater exposure and seismic activity pose threats. Vibration, excessive loads, and material degradation can lead to breakdowns. Timely repairs and modernization ensure longevity. From the iconic Golden Gate to the mighty Akashi Kaikyō, suspension 
      bridges stand as testaments to human ingenuity and meticulous care.

       Here we will be looking about how suspension bridges, which are probably one of the most complicated modern bridges ever to construct is maintained and repaired to increase the bridges lifespan. There are many factors which get involved from cost to efficiency and how much we increase the lifespan by. There are also many factors which
       causes a bridge to decrease its lifespan such as traffic volume, environmental factors etc. Suspension bridges specially are hard to maintain since they are suspending. It is possible to extend the lifespan by 20-30 years by repairing and maintenance. Usually after 30 years, the suspension cables should be unwrapped and the interior and
       should be inspected carefully in depth. This is done to ensure that the suspension bridge is still able to hold together without breaking.
